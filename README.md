# Clustering-Airline-Customers-with-Advanced-Data-Mining-Techniques
**Objective**: This project focuses on segmenting airline customers into distinct clusters based on their behavior and attributes using advanced clustering techniques. The primary goal is to identify and label customer segments to target them effectively with marketing strategies.

### Methodology:

**Data Preparation**: The dataset was preprocessed by removing irrelevant features, converting categorical data into numerical values, and scaling the data to standardize it.

**Hierarchical Clustering**: Applied hierarchical clustering using Euclidean distance and complete linkage to determine the optimal number of clusters based on the silhouette index.

**Cluster Characterization**: After clustering, the centroids were analyzed to understand the characteristics of each cluster, leading to meaningful labels such as "Irregular Customers" and "Premium Customers."

**Stability Check**: The stability of the clusters was tested by removing a random 5% of the data and repeating the clustering process, confirming the robustness of the identified clusters.

**K-Means Clustering**: The K-Means algorithm was also applied to validate the clustering results, comparing them with the hierarchical clustering outcomes.

**Targeting Strategy**: Based on the cluster analysis, a strategy was developed to target specific clusters with tailored offers to increase customer loyalty.

**Programming Language**: R

**Summary**: This project demonstrates proficiency in R and data mining techniques, utilizing hierarchical and K-Means clustering methods to segment airline customers effectively. By analyzing and characterizing the clusters, the project highlights a strong understanding of customer behavior and the ability to develop targeted marketing strategies. The results suggest that "Premium Customers" and "Irregular Customers" can be identified, allowing for strategic interventions to enhance customer engagement.
